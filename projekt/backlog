This is the backlog of the TUwoC project. Items are prioritized by the product
owner and estimated by the team.

Pri  Estimation  Description
001              Get acquainted with open source software development tools.
                 Goal: Everyone is able to checkout any Apache project, build
                 it from source, apply patches to it. Students are subscribed
                 to the mailinglists of those projects they are going to use
                 throughout the course. Students are able to generate patches
                 from code modifications, to be shown in documentation patches
                 that are submitted to your favourite project.

003              Hadoop: Set up your first own cluster. Write a test job that
                 communicates with the database system to be used for document
                 storage after processing.

005              Web Crawling: Set up a pipeline to crawl web pages that
                 stores the pages in a document database in HDFS.

007              UIMA - set up first rudimentary pipeline for continuous
                 processing and tokenization. Integrate with database system to
                 be used for document storage after crawling.

009              Setup a solr search server to index the annotated postings.

012              Get Spectral clustering to work in Mahout.

015              Extend the crawler to only store blog postings.

017              Integrate the uima processed documents with Mahout. Try to
                 identify topic-clusters in said documents. Compare the
                 existing algorithms with Spectral clustering (to be
                 implemented in separate issue).

020              Extend the processing pipeline to support for stemming.

030              Extend the processing pipeline to filter stop words.
