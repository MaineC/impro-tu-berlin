This is the backlog of the TUwoC project. Items are prioritized by the product
owner and estimated by the team.

Pri  Estimation  Description
001              Integrate Crawling and Hadoop
     13             Store documents in HBase
     05             Retrieve documents from HBase
     01.5           Retrieve blogs only

002              Integrate Mahout and HBase
     08             Generate vectors from docs to HDFS
     03             Use k-Means to cluster docs.
     13             Use one post in cluster for cluster title
                    Extend Mahout to support for matching docs to their clusters.

003              Theoretical overview of document stream clustering
     07             Read Kleinberg news clustering paper + references + understand
                    Also have a look at the parallel spectral clustering paper.
     08             Select most promising aproach and discuss on tuwoc@isabel-drost.de
     21             Discuss your choice on mahout-user@lucene.apache.org
     13             Start implementing your selected algorithm

004              Cluster assignment should be visible in Solr search
     02             Create appropriate fields
     03             Use facetted search for easy visualization

012              Get Spectral clustering to work in Mahout.

017              Integrate the uima processed documents with Mahout. Try to
                 identify topic-clusters in said documents. Compare the
                 existing algorithms with Spectral clustering (to be
                 implemented in separate issue).

020              Extend the processing pipeline to support for stemming.

030              Extend the processing pipeline to filter stop words.
