There are 100 points in total to reach. Depending on the percentage of points actually
received, the number of credits is computed and ceiled.

Example: Student received 50 points, this corresponds to 50%. In case of 2 credits
available, the student will receive 1 credit. In case of fractions, the function
java.util.Math.ceil() is applied to the resulting credit number.
