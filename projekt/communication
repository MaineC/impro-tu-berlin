Progress review happens every week on Friday morning. During the first hour students (the team) present their achievements
of the past week. During the second hour the team (together with the product owner) chooses the user stories to
implement during the next iteration.

Success is measured in user stories implemented vs. user stories "promised" one week earlier. First four weeks are
used for calibration - that is for students to learn how many stories they can actually implement during one
iteration. Iterations are of length 7 days.

The first week is used for introductory work - students get to read, learn and present on topics needed for open source
development. Every student taking part in the second project course need to prepare a presentation on one of the topics
in the introtopics file. Plan to spend 3h for reading and understanding, 1h for preparing the slides. Plan for talks
of 15 to 20 minutes.
