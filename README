The purpose of this repository is to organise a Mahout seminar at TU Berlin. It is organised as follows:

  - bug tracker contains all organisational issues to resolve related to the project/seminar.
  - repository contains all organisational documents, such as student questions, recommended literature, proposed topics
  - wiki contains the overall documentation.

If you are student in the course, feel free to track issues via that project.
